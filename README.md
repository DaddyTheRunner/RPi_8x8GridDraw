# AstroPiGridDraw

This Python Pygame application is for creating 8x8 pixel images for loading onto the Raspberry Pi [Astro-Pi] (http://astro-pi.org/hardware/) HAT LED matrix.

It offers a choice of several colours for the LEDs:

Red, Blue, Green, Yellow, White, Orange, Pink, Purple

It can export the created image to a png (this will write to a file called image8x8.png), print the Python list to the console, or load it directly onto the Astro-Pi Hat. 

See my [blog] (http://richardhayler.blogspot.com/2015/06/creating-images-for-astro-pi-hat.html) for more details, screenshots, updates and other Raspberry Pi projects.
